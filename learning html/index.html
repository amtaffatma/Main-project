    <p style="color: black";>The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886,
        when German inventor
        Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.<a href="https://wikipedia.com">Commercial cars</a> became widely available during the 20th century.
        One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford
        Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.<sup>[3]</sup> In
        Europe and
        other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.<sup>[4]</sup> The
        car is
        considered an essential part of the developed economy.

    <p>The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and
    climate change.<sup>[46]</sup>

    Most cars in use in the early 2020s run on petrol burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International
    Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulphur motor spirit,
    petrol-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution.<sup>[47][48]</sup>
    Some cities ban <a href="https://youtube.com">petrol-driven cars</a> and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However, some environmental
    groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change. Production of
    petrol-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.<sup>[49][50]</sup></p>
